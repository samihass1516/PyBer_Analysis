# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose:
This new analysis aims to provide a data analysis for PyBer, a data Python-based ridesharing app company.  My assignment will be to perform an exploratory study on data in some large CSV files.  To make this project possible, I need to write Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.  The results from the analysis and visualizations will help PyBer promote access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underprivileged neighborhoods.

## Results:

The line graph shown above is a great graph and an easy graph to track changes over a short period of time.  And in this case, we can see that from January until April, urban cities had the highest rides, and rural towns have the lowest.  These results were not surprising; urban cities tend to always have higher demands for transportation because of the population.  We can aslo see from the graph, that urban cities were somewhat in demand in February and first weeks of April.

Also, in this chart, the drivers in the urban cities are getting paid 3x less than the rural city drivers.  In metropolitan cities, they are getting paid $16.57, and in rural, they are getting paid $55.49. And the average fare per ride in Urban is $24.53, whereas in rural its $34.62. meaning it can bring in more rave and. It would make sense since there are fewer total rides in rural and less in demand, and that’s why it’s more expensive.
## Summary:
After completing my data analysis on this challenge, my recommendations for the CEO of the company might be:
1.	Increase the total drivers for the rural and suburban areas; this way, it can cut the average fare per ride cost.  And this might attract more customers to use the   ridesharing app.
2.	Urban cities have the highest rate of the total fares; I recommend investing in them because they bring in more revenue.
3.	In the following research, I would focus on the whole year instead of just the first few months.  In the data, I would use the entire year, all seasons, to visualize and make better sense of the company.
